+ [detail](https://sammiee5311.github.io/project/Find-Missing-People/)

## The motivation
+ There are a number of criminal activities nowadays, I wanted to make a program that makes finding people easier. <br>
+ However, everyone who has a self-driving car can help to find people. <br>
+ The camera which is attached on the car will look faces during people driving so that it will be easier to find people.

## Test
